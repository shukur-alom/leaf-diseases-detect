# Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning

![Demo](https://github.com/shukur-alom/leaf-diseases-detect/blob/main/Media/website.gif)


This project is a leaf disease detection system that uses deep learning techniques, including transfer learning, to identify and classify 33 different types of leaf diseases. The model has been trained on a large dataset of images and is designed to help agricultural professionals and enthusiasts diagnose plant diseases in a fast and accurate manner.


## Usage

To use the model for leaf disease detection, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a Python environment set up with the necessary libraries installed. You can use the provided requirements.txt file to set up the required dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run main.py

```
streamlit run main.py 
```

## Model Details
The leaf disease detection model is built using deep learning techniques, and it uses transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained knowledge of a base model. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of 33 different types of leaf diseases. For more information about the architecture, dataset, and training process, please refer to the code and documentation provided.


## Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the contributions of the open-source community and the creators of the base model that this project builds upon. Your work and support are greatly appreciated.
