# Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning



The leaf disease detection model is built using deep learning techniques, and it uses transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained knowledge of a base model. 
The model is trained on a dataset containing images of 10 different types of rice leaf diseases.


## Usage

To use the model for leaf disease detection, follow these steps:

1. Create your virtual environment

```
conda activate 
```

2. Make sure you have a Python environment set up with the necessary libraries installed. You can use the provided requirements.txt file to set up the required dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run main.py

```
streamlit run main.py 
```

## Model Details
The leaf disease detection model is built using deep learning techniques, and it uses transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained knowledge of a base model. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of 33 different types of leaf diseases. For more information about the architecture, dataset, and training process, please refer to the code and documentation provided.


## Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the contributions of the open-source community and the creators of the base model that this project builds upon. Your work and support are greatly appreciated.
